##  Exercise
 1) Safely access the first account in the 'accounts' vector using the
    .first_mut() method.
 2) '.first_mut()' returns an Option whose Some variant is a mutable ref to
     an Account. Use a 'match' statement to figure out if
     you have a Some or a None
 3) In the Some case, set the balance of the account to 30, then print the account
 4) In the None case, print the message "No account found"
 Hint: You might have to add in the 'mut' keyword somewhere...


```rust
 #[derive(Debug)]
 struct Account {
     balance: i32
 }

 fn main() {
     let mut accounts: Vec<Account> = vec![
          Account { balance: 0 },
          Account { balance: 10 }
     ];

      Add code here:
     match accounts.first_mut() {
         Some(account) => {
             account.balance = 30;
             println!("account : {:#?}",account)
         }
         None => {
             println!("No account found")
         }
     }

     println!("summary {:#?}",accounts)

}
```
